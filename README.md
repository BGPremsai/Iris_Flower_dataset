The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set used. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

In this project we have applied Machine learning with python language using scikit tools. It became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines. Algorithm used for predicting and getting accuracy are-

1. logistic regression
2. K nearest
3. SVM
4. Dicision tre classifier
